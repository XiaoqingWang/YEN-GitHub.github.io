# Hydejack
Hydejack is a cutting-edge Jekyll theme that combines the best of static sites and modern web apps. It features a suite of JavaScript that makes the page feel like an app, without sacrificing backwards-compatibility, page-load speed or SEO.

* Support for categories and tags --- even when hosting on GitHub Pages

## Skin in the Game
I use Hydejack for [my personal site](https://qwtel.com/), which is why the theme has features well beyond what you would expect from a normal Jekyll theme and why I have an interest in making it as good as I possibly can.
